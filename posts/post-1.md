review: I wasn't too sure about this book going into it! When I started reading it, I was feeling a huge disconect with the characters because thier culture was so different from mine. However once the plot started to pick up, and there were mysterys to unravel between our characters, I was instantly hooked! This book was a slow burn for sure. The connection between the past and the present, and finding out who you are at your core was so beautiful.
